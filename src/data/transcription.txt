Patient  00:01
Okay,

Dora  00:03
so do you have, do you have a long I guess not, not up there. Say, I was raised in New York, but I guess up there y'all don't have too long of a growing season. Do you,

Patient  00:13
well, we probably have about three months.

Dora  00:16
Do you do your own gardening?

Patient  00:19
We live on a used to be a farm, but we don't farm it. We but we do have a garden.

Dora  00:26
See, I got mine in. Well, let's see, I put in Pepper plants this weekend.

Patient  00:31
Wish I could be doing that.

Dora  00:34
I got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen, and I enjoy tinkering with it. You know, it's pretty hot down here during the summer we had, you know, 100, 102 sometimes, no, we don't do too much during the summer. As far as tomatoes,

Patient  00:46
you almost have to get started pretty early. Probably, yeah,

Dora  00:49
I can easily. I can put in, oh, probably mid March. I can put anything in the ground, you know, beets, onions and stuff like that. But then I have to wait for my tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks, as soon as we're sure we're not going to have another freeze finish it. You've

Patient  01:09
had more freezing this winter, or this is, yeah, winter, I think,

Dora  01:12
yeah, we had weather just a few. You know, freezes a little here and there, but every once in a while, we get a freeze around the middle of April, and it's pretty tough. 

Patient  01:22
Are you do you work? Are you retired? 

Dora  01:25
Oh no, I work. I'm only 40 years old. I have to work.

Patient  01:31
My husband's retired, but he's not a gardener. He's been helping me more, but he really is real crazy about gardening.

Dora  01:41
I really enjoy it. It gives me time outdoors. You know, I'm a golfer, but it gives me time outdoors and time around my house. And I burned my grass off here in the last couple of days, getting ready to start for the spring season and seeing if I can grow me another nice lot. I usually have a pretty nice lot. It's a lot of work.
